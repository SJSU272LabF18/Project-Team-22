## Project Idea 1 : Stuff Exchange

Project description:
Don't we all want to exchange stuff once we are done using it or are probably bored with it?
Tired of buying a costume every year for Hallowen and never using it again? Exchange it!
Have a dress but it doesn't fit anymore? Exchange it!
We offer a way to fullfil your wish!
We offer the following services:
1) Let user login securely.
2) Browse for items that are up for exchange.
3) Choose the items for exchange or add them to cart or wishlist.
4) Chat with the item owners and negotiate. Offer an item in exchange or let the item owner visit your profile and choose from the items.
If both the parties agree, Voila!
You now own something new and exciting that you can actually use!

Note: As a part of this project, the website will not take care of the item shipping processes. In the future however, doorstep pickup and delivery can be added.


## Project Idea 2 : Stock Analysis and Prediction
Project description:
Long term investment is one of the major investment strategies. However, calculating intrinsic value of some company and evaluating shares for long term investment is not easy, since analysts have to consider a large number of financial indicators and evaluate them in a correct manner.
So, in this project, we propose to explore the financial data with object oriented programming and additive models.
We offer the following methods for analyzing and predicting stock prices:
1. Plot stock history
2. Find significant change points and try to correlate with Google search trends
3. Make basic prophet model
4. Evaluate the Prophet model predictions against real prices and play stock market
5. Predict future prices
